'''
Does entries data from the previous exercise seem normally distributed?

Ans: NO

Can we run Welch's T test on entries data? why or why not?

Ans: No, we can not as the assumption to perform T test is to have normally distributed data.

'''
Is the distribution of the number of entries statistically different between rainy & non rainy days?

Ans: YES

Describe your results and the methods used:

Ans: The p-value calculated using Mann-Whitney method is 0.019 which is a small number. This shows that the
    Null hypothesis could be rejected and the distribution of number of entries between rainy and non rainy
    days are statistically different.

    The NYC turnstile data is stored in a pandas dataframe called weather_turnstile.
    Using the information stored in the dataframe, let's predict the ridership of
    the NYC subway using linear regression with gradient descent.

    You can download the complete turnstile weather dataframe here:
    https://www.dropbox.com/s/meyki2wl9xfa7yk/turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv

    Your prediction should have a R^2 value of 0.40 or better.
    You need to experiment using various input features contained in the dataframe.
    We recommend that you don't use the EXITSn_hourly feature as an input to the
    linear model because we cannot use it as a predictor: we cannot use exits
    counts as a way to predict entry counts.

    Note: Due to the memory and CPU limitation of our Amazon EC2 instance, we will
    give you a random subet (~15%) of the data contained in
    turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv. You are encouraged to experiment with
    this computer on your own computer, locally.


    If you'd like to view a plot of your cost history, uncomment the call to
    plot_cost_history below. The slowdown from plotting is significant, so if you
    are timing out, the first thing to do is to comment out the plot command again.

    If you receive a "server has encountered an error" message, that means you are
    hitting the 30-second limit that's placed on running your program. Try using a
    smaller number for num_iterations if that's the case.

    If you are using your own algorithm/models, see if you can optimize your code so
    that it runs faster.
